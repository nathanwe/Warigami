;   TCR compliant Sample install script.
;   Put this file in the root for what you want included in the installer,
;   then put everything into the subdirectories as listed in the installer below.
;   Created by Chris Onorati.
;
;   !!NOTE!!
;   exe of your game ==MUST== match the name of your game.  For example, a game
;   called "Gooball" must have an exe to start the game called "Gooball.exe".
;
;   !!NOTE!!
; There are three steps that you must perform in order to customize this script
;   for your project (see all "TODO" comments below):
;   1) Generate a new GUID for your game (the AppId).
;   2) Replace YOUR_GAME_NAME_HERE on line 19 with your game name.
;   3) Replace 0.0.0 on line 20 with the current version number of your game.
;   4) Update the redistributables required for your game.

; I recommend placing any installers for required stuff (DirectX, PhysX, etc)
;   in the general structure below to keep things neat for you.
